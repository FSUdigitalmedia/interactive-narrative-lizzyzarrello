[[Try Again|Q5]]

:: safety

Correct! You spring through the maze and reach the light. Its a large beam coming from a rectangular frame. 
When you manouver through the frame, you are suddenly back in the museum. Safe and [[sound.]]

:: sound. 

Overwhelmed and out of breath you sit for a moment to regain your composure. 

Once you start to take steady breaths you stand up, collect your belongings, and once again walk through the once again filled museum towards the exit. 
Dumbfounded by what just happened. You hear a voice scream "<<print $name>>",

You stand still for a moment, unsure if you ever escaped. 

You look towards the voice and see your teacher, "<<print $name>>, where have you been!? Don't make me give you a detention for sneaking off!"

You apologize to the teacher and follow her towards the bus, but not without looking back towards the museum, listening to the screams growing quieter with each foot of distance[[...]]

:: ...
Perhaps you were still only an earshot away from the painting, or maybe you too were moved to insanity.
